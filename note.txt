Make sure Django is downloaded onto your computer from: https://www.djangoproject.com/
If not working, move the django folder under this project.

1. src folder contains the extraction info for getting the data from the database(?)
   You can run the test.py file to check if absolute path works and get a sample of what data is returned

2. Updates about web programming should be made in the files located in webpage/static folder
   !(NOT webpage/webpage/static folder!)!
   Even though you did, you might not see the updates you made on the server

3. For using the front end, cd webpage, then
   a. py manage.py runserver      -- start front end
   b. py manage.py collectstatic  -- run after step 2 (if updates are not implemented)
   c. py manage.py migrate        -- after deletion/addition new files (in the folder mentioned in No.2)

4. Adjusting webpage/webpage/settings.py as necessary (e.g. last line),
   but PLEASE DON'T COMMIT changes made with absolute path, thanks.

5. Future works:
   a. About the program overall: getting data back from the user, and store it somewhere
   b. Frontend: Display the appropriate data and record what user typed/picked.
   c. Potential work: Django's database(SQL) in models.py, privacy concerns, Web publication and maintenance.
